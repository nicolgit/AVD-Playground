# Playground design

This diagram shows a typical <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/example-scenario/wvd/windows-virtual-desktop" target="_blank">architectural setup</a> for Azure Virtual Desktop

![Azure Virtual Desktop reference architecture](images/azure-virtual-desktop.png)

* The application endpoints are in the customer's on-premises network. 
* ExpressRoute extends the on-premises network into the Azure cloud, and Azure AD Connect integrates the customer's Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
* The Azure Virtual Desktop control plane handles Web Access, Gateway, Broker, Diagnostics, and extensibility components like REST APIs.
* The customer manages AD DS and Azure AD, Azure subscriptions, virtual networks, Azure Files or Azure NetApp Files, and the Windows Virtual Desktop host pools and workspaces.
* To increase capacity, in this schema, the customer uses two Azure subscriptions in a hub-spoke architecture, and connects them via virtual network peering.

The diagram below shows the AVD playground we will create:

![Lab Architecture](images/lab-architecture.png)

* a V-Net with 2 subnets
    * subnetAD: in this subnet will be deployed an istance of Azure Active Directory Domain  Services. This full managed Active Domain will simplify the setup because  with few clicks you will have 2 Active Directory servers fully managed with an Azure AD Connect in place, an ideal configuration for WVD
    * subnetClients: in this subnet will be deployed all hosts (VM) used by WVD
* 2 Host pools (MilanoPool and RomaPool)
* MilanoPool has
    * 2 hosts (Milanovm-1 and Milanovm-2)
    * 1 Application group (MilanoDAG) with desktop access
* Romapool has
    * 1 host (romavm-1)
    * 1 Application group (RomaDAM) with desktop access
    * 1 Application group (RomaApplications) with 3 apps 

![Lab Configuration](images/lab-configuration.png)

Users will have the following access:

| User   | Application Groups                   |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| User01 | RomaPoolDAG, MilanoPoolDAG, RomaApplications |
| User02 | RomaApplications                     |
| User03 | RomaApplications                     |



# Prerequisites

in order to create this lab you need:

* an Azure subscription (also Visual Studio subscribers benefit is ok)
* an Azure Active Directory Tenant where you are able to create users, groups etc.

> from cloud shell execute [01-resource-group.sh](shell-script/01-resource-group.sh) using the command `source 01-resource-group.sh`

# Azure Active Directory preparation

If you plan to create and destroy the lab, using the same Azure Active Directory, **it is important to delete and re-create these account each time you rebuild the environemnt**.

| User UPN                                  | password       | role
|-------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------
| user01@\<yourtenantname\>.onmicrosoft.com | pa.123.assword |Active Directory administrator
| user02@\<yourtenantname\>.onmicrosoft.com | pa.123.assword |standard user
| user03@\<yourtenantname\>.onmicrosoft.com | pa.123.assword |standard user

# Azure AD Domain Services

From Azure portal, create an Azure AD Domain Services with the following parameters:

Basic
* DNS domain name: `demo.nicold`
* Region: `any`
* SKU: `standard`
* Forest type: `user`

Network
* Virtual Network: `aadds-vnet`
* Subnet: `aadds-subnet`

Administration
* Notifications
    * All Global Administrators of the Azure AD directory.
    * Members of the AAD DC Administrators group.
      * Add `User01` as administrator

| Groups                                    | members 
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------
| AAD DC Administrators                     | user01@<yourtenantname\>.onmicrosoft.com

Synchronicazion
* Synchronization type: All

Security Settings
* keep all default settings

when the deploy finish:
* the activity coud require more than 1 hour for the first sync
* Fix the DNS following the recomendation shown on overview page
* access with user01 and user02 on portal.azure.com and change the password so that the password is replicated also back in AD

# Virtual Network
The previous step creates also the following virtual network:
* Name: `aadds-vnet`
* Address space: `10.0.0.0/24`
* Subnets (name - range)
    * `aadds-subnet` - `10.0.0.0/24`

On this virtual network you need to add another subnet for your host pools, as following:

* Add the Address space: `10.0.1.0/24`
* Subnets (name - range)
    * `subnetClients` - `10.0.1.0/24`

# Finalize AD Domain Services setup
* Wait a least `2 hours` to allow AADDS service creation and first accounts sync from AAD to AADDS.
* From Azure Portal, go to AADDS and fix the `DNS issue`
* For each account (`User01`, `User02`, `User03`)
  * Open an in private browser window, navigate to <https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/ChangePassword.aspx> and change his password. This forces a user password sync AAD->AD and it is required to allows users to logon on virtual machines
